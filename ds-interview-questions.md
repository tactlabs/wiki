You are about to send one million email (marketing campaign). How do you optimze delivery? How do you optimize response? Can you optimize both separately? (answer: not really)

Toad or Brio or any other similar clients are quite inefficient to query Oracle databases. Why? How would you do to increase speed by a factor 10, and be able to handle far bigger 
outputs? 

How would you turn unstructured data into structured data? Is it really necessary? Is it OK to store data as flat text files rather than in an SQL-powered RDBMS?

Give a few examples of "best practices" in data science.

What could make a chart misleading, difficult to read or interpret? What features should a useful chart have?

Do you know a few "rules of thumb" used in statistical or computer science? Or in business analytics?

What are your top 5 predictions for the next 20 years?

How do you immediately know when statistics published in an article (e.g. newspaper) are either wrong or presented to support the author's point of view, rather than correct, 
comprehensive factual information on a specific subject? For instance, what do you think about the official monthly unemployment statistics regularly discussed in the press? What could 
make them more accurate?

Testing your analytic intuition: look at these three charts. Two of them exhibit patterns. Which ones? Do you know that these charts are called scatter-plots? Are there other ways to 
visually represent this type of data?

You design a robust non-parametric statistic (metric) to replace correlation or R square, that (1) is independent of sample size, (2) always between -1 and +1, and (3) based on rank statistics. How do you normalize for sample size? Write an algorithm that computes all permutations of n elements. How do you sample permutations (that is, generate tons of random permutations) when n is large, to estimate the asymptotic distribution for your newly created metric? You may use this asymptotic distribution for normalizing your metric. Do you think that an exact theoretical distribution might exist, and therefore, we should find it, and use it rather than wasting our time trying to estimate the asymptotic distribution using 
simulations? 

More difficult, technical question related to previous one. There is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between permutations of n elements and integers between 1 and n! Design an algorithm that encodes an integer less than n! as a permutation of n elements. What would be the reverse algorithm, used to decode a permutation and transform it back into a number? Hint: An intermediate step is to use the factorial number system representation of an integer. Feel free to check this reference online to answer the question. Even better, feel free to browse the web to find the full answer to the question (this will test the candidate's ability to quickly search online and find a solution to a problem without spending hours reinventing the wheel).  

How many "useful" votes will a Yelp review receive? My answer: Eliminate bogus accounts (read this article), or competitor reviews (how to detect them: use taxonomy to classify users, and location - two Italian restaurants in same Zip code could badmouth each other and write great comments for themselves). Detect fake likes: some companies (e.g. FanMeNow.com) will charge you to produce fake accounts and fake likes. Eliminate prolific users who like everything, those who hate everything. Have a blacklist of keywords to filter fake reviews. See if IP address or IP block of reviewer is in a blacklist such as "Stop Forum Spam". Create honeypot to catch fraudsters.  Also watch out for disgruntled employees badmouthing their former employer. Watch out for 2 or 3 similar comments posted the same day by 3 users regarding a company that receives very few reviews. Is it a brand new company? Add more weight to trusted users (create a category of trusted users).  Flag all reviews that are identical (or nearly identical) and come from same IP address or same user. Create a metric to measure distance between two pieces of text (reviews). Create a review or reviewer taxonomy. Use hidden decision trees to rate or score review and reviewers.

Should removing stop words be Step 1 rather than Step 3, in the search engine algorithm described here? Answer: Have you thought about the fact that mine and yours could also be stop words? So in a bad implementation, data mining would become data mine after stemming, then data. In practice, you remove stop words before stemming. So Step 3 should indeed become step

### Sample Notes

#### Sample 1
```
Running crontab -e edits users' crontabs (rather than the system crontab /etc/crontab). 
If you run sudo crontab -e, this edits the root account's user crontab (which is not the same as /etc/crontab). 
The root account's user crontab is usable, but is often not what system administrators wish to edit.

#### Sample 2
```
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is often interchanged or confused with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). But GMT is a time zone and UTC is a time standard.

#### Sample 3
```
GMT is a time zone officially used in some European and African countries. The time can be displayed using both the 24-hour format (0 - 24) or the 12-hour format (1 - 12 am/pm).
UTC is not a time zone, but a time standard that is the basis for civil time and time zones worldwide. This means that no country or territory officially uses UTC as a local time.

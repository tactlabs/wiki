# TactSay Tech: General Python


1. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

2. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.

3. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.

4. It is a dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type)

5. Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)

6. Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting.

7. Python is is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.

8. Somewhat similar to the English language, with a mathematical influence, Python is built for readability

9. The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.

10. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability.
